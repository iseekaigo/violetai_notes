# violetai_notes

VioletAI is the first-ever AI-powered GameFi character and AI VTuber from the ISEEKAIGO Projectâ€”an interactive, token-enabled persona that connects gaming, AI agents, AR, and web3 innovation.

The Violet AI token ($VioletAI) is a fan-driven cryptocurrency inspired by Violet AI, the flagship UR (ultra rare) NFT AI character of the Iseekaigo universe. As a core utility token, $VioletAI unlocks exclusive opportunities for holders, including the ability for the top 20 holders to redeem Violet NFTs upon Iseekaigo's mainnet launch. When the Iseekaigo project is fully released, $VioletAI will power in-app and in-game transactions such as purchases, trading, gacha mechanics, staking, and more, solidifying its place at the heart of the ecosystem.
